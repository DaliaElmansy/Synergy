#Synergy #MutualInformation #InformationTheory #SNP #Single Nucleotide Polymorphism #genes #backupGenes .

Uses Information Theory concepts to model and assess association of factors (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism SNP, Genes, etc.) with a disease.
Calculates Mutual Information, two way synergy and three-way synergy to calculate gene backup scores.
